<p>**Course Project:** </p> 
Read in a multi-FASTA file and answered the following questions:
- number of sequences
- length of longest / shortest sequences and their identifiers
- given a reading frame (1, 2, 3), find all open reading frames in that reading frame. Report the length of the longest ORF and its identifier. Find the longest ORF in a given sequence and it's index in that sequence.
