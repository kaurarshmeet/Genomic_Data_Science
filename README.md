**Course Project**

For the course project, I read in a multi-FASTA file and answered the following questions:

1. **Number of sequences**
2. **Length of the longest and shortest sequences and their identifiers**
3. **Given a reading frame (1, 2, 3), find all open reading frames in that reading frame. Report the length of the longest ORF and its identifier.**
4. **Find the longest ORF in a given sequence and its index in that sequence**
