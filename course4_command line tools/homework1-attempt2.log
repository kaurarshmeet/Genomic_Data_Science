❯ # Question 4:
❯ # Question 17:
How many genes are in common to all three conditions?

❯ # Question 3: How many transcript variants?
❯ cut -f2 apple.genes| uniq -c | wc -l

❯ # Question 4: How many genes have a single splice variant?
❯ # single splice variant: a single splice variant is a gene that only has one transcript id expressed for the gene.
❯ cut -f1 apple.genes| uniq -c | less # get the gene lines, count how many times each gene is mentioned
❯ cut -f1 apple.genes| uniq -c | grep -c " 1 "  # get the gene lines, count how many times each gene is mentioned, count how many of those lines with counts have count = 1

❯ # Question 5: Two or more splice variants?
❯ cut -f1 apple.genes| uniq -c | grep -v " 1 " | wc -l  # get the gene lines, count how many times each gene is mentioned, exclude lines with count = 1, count number of lines left
